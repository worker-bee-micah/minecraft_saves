This file contains the locations where we have built our castles.

The main castle is located at XYZ: 4260 / 112 / 525
Follow the stairs down the inside of the castle, and you will find our minecart 
track that takes you to a sea monument.  

There is another sea monumnet nearby at 4375 / 61 / 318 , look for a purple beacon
This monumnet has been dried out and has two entrances, one at the top and a 
redstone door underwater.  

Nearby is a secret cove, the entrance is through a brick skull at

XYZ: 4250 / 61 / 945

We plan to build a village along the steep walls inside the cove to produce
food and timber for the castle later.
